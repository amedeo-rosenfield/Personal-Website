                    <p>
                        Born in 2004 in sunny San Diego, California, and raised in Silver Spring, Maryland, my story began with a spirit of exploration and determination. At Blair High School, where I was part of the Communication Arts Magnet Program and earned MVP honors on the lacrosse team, I learned early on the power of dedication, teamwork, and pushing beyond limits, qualities that continue to shape my path today.

                    <p>
                        Summers spent traveling solo to Italy to visit family in Bologna helped me cultivate independence and cultural awareness, teaching me to adapt and thrive in new environments. These experiences gave me a global perspective and the confidence to navigate change, skills vital in today's fast-paced world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Entrepreneurship became a natural outlet for my drive to create and grow. From digitization services to reselling ventures and yard work businesses, I learned invaluable lessons about resilience, calculated risk-taking, and hard work.

                    <p>
                        Currently, I am pursuing a B.S. in Aerospace Engineering with a minor in Robotics and Autonomous Systems at the University of Maryland. College has been a launchpad for hands-on innovation, designing spacecraft systems, mastering CAD modeling, additive manufacturing, and building robotics suited for lunar and Martian environments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My passion for innovation deepened during my internship in Bologna at Glenair Italia, where I designed precise 3D models and detailed 2D technical drawings for aerospace and defense interconnectors. The full internship was conducted in Italian, enriching both my language skills and professional adaptability in an international engineering setting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, I am interning at Space Copy working directly under CEO Madison Feehan to design lunar printing machines using additive manufacturing technologies. This role embodies my commitment to pushing aerospace boundaries and embracing cutting-edge innovation.

                    <p>
                        Parallel to my engineering pursuits, I am deeply engaged in AI engineering, firmly believing that artificial intelligence will revolutionize every job as we know it. Adaptability is key in this rapidly evolving landscape, and I am proud to be on the front lines of this revolution. I am currently developing an emotional intelligence powered productivity coach and coding personalized websites, integrating new AI tools into every project I undertake.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beyond academics and engineering, I find balance through music production, photography, and regular gym sessions, activities that fuel my creativity and resilience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My journey is one of continuous growth and adaptability, a mission to build technologies that not only advance space exploration but also transform how humans interact with intelligent systems, shaping a future where innovation and empathy coexist.
