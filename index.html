                            A journey of passion, innovation, and continuous growth through aerospace engineering, entrepreneurship, and creative pursuits.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I was born in 2004 in San Diego, California, and grew up in Silver Spring, Maryland. My journey began at Blair High School, where I earned the MVP award for lacrosse in my senior year—a testament to my dedication and competitive spirit that continues to drive me today.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Growing up, I spent many summers traveling solo to Italy to visit family, experiences that helped shape my independence and broaden my perspective on the world. These formative years taught me the value of adaptability and cultural awareness—skills that serve me well in today's interconnected world.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During those early years, I worked various jobs and started several small businesses, including a digitization service, a reselling business, a yard work venture, and investing. These experiences fueled my entrepreneurial spirit and taught me valuable lessons about hard work, resilience, and the importance of taking calculated risks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm currently pursuing a B.S. in Aerospace Engineering with a minor in Robotics and Autonomous Systems at the University of Maryland. College has been an exciting journey of growth, allowing me to engage in hands-on projects focused on design, prototyping, and systems engineering. I've developed strong skills in spacecraft systems, CAD modeling, additive manufacturing, and robotics designed for extreme environments like the Moon and Mars.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Along the way, I discovered a growing passion for AI engineering. I'm fascinated by how artificial intelligence can solve complex problems and accelerate innovation, especially when combined with aerospace technology. This passion drives me to create intelligent systems that improve mission success and expand humanity's reach into space.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This summer, I'm interning at Glenair Italia, where I design 3D models and detailed 2D technical drawings for interconnectors used in aerospace, defense, railway, and industrial sectors. This experience has deepened my appreciation for precision engineering and the importance of reliability in mission-critical systems.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Outside of academics and engineering, I enjoy music production, photography, and going to the gym. I'm committed to lifelong learning, embracing challenges, and building technologies that contribute meaningfully to our future beyond Earth.
                        </p>
